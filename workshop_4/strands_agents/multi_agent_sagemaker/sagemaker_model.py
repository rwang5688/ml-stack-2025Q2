"""
SageMaker Integration with Strands Agents

Using the native Strands SDK SageMaker support.

IMPORTANT MODEL COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
===================================
Model Compatibility:
The SageMaker provider is designed to work with models that support OpenAI-compatible chat 
completion APIs. During development and testing, the provider has been validated with 
Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501, which demonstrated reliable performance across various 
conversational AI tasks.

Base language models (like Open Llama 7b V2) will fail with "Template error: template not found"
because they lack the required chat completion API compatibility.

Reference: https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/sagemaker/

Note: Tool calling support varies by model. Models like Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501 have 
demonstrated reliable tool calling capabilities, but not all models deployed on SageMaker support 
this feature. Verify your model's capabilities before implementing tool-based workflows.
