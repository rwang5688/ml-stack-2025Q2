# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a new multi-agent system called `multi_agent_sagemaker` by copying the existing `multi_agent_example` and adapting it to work with Amazon SageMaker Inference Endpoints instead of the default model endpoint. The system will maintain the same multi-agent architecture with specialized agents (Math, English, Language, Computer Science, and General assistants) but will route all model inference requests through SageMaker endpoints for improved scalability, performance, and enterprise-grade deployment capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to copy the existing multi_agent_example to create a new multi_agent_sagemaker version, so that I can have a separate implementation that uses SageMaker endpoints without affecting the original example.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the copy operation is performed THEN the system SHALL create a new directory called `multi_agent_sagemaker` under `workshop_4/strands_agents/`
2. WHEN the copy is complete THEN the new directory SHALL contain all files from the original `multi_agent_example` with identical structure
3. WHEN files are copied THEN all Python imports and references SHALL be updated to reflect the new directory name
4. WHEN the copy is verified THEN the new system SHALL be functionally identical to the original before any SageMaker modifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the multi_agent_sagemaker system to use SageMaker Inference Endpoints for all model calls, so that I can leverage enterprise-grade ML infrastructure with better scalability and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent needs to make a model inference call THEN the system SHALL route the request to a SageMaker Inference Endpoint
2. WHEN configuring SageMaker endpoints THEN the system SHALL support configurable endpoint names and regions
3. WHEN making SageMaker calls THEN the system SHALL handle authentication using AWS credentials
4. WHEN SageMaker endpoints are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and graceful degradation
5. WHEN multiple agents make concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage SageMaker endpoint connections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SageMaker integration to be configurable, so that I can easily switch between different endpoints and environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read SageMaker configuration from environment variables or configuration files
2. WHEN configuration includes endpoint names THEN the system SHALL validate endpoint accessibility before processing requests
3. WHEN configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with guidance
4. WHEN different environments are used THEN the system SHALL support different endpoint configurations per environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the multi_agent_sagemaker system to provide the same functionality as the original system, so that I can continue using all the specialized agents without any loss of capability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask mathematical questions THEN the Math Assistant SHALL provide accurate calculations using SageMaker endpoints
2. WHEN I ask English-related questions THEN the English Assistant SHALL provide grammar and writing assistance using SageMaker endpoints
3. WHEN I ask for translations THEN the Language Assistant SHALL provide accurate translations using SageMaker endpoints
4. WHEN I ask programming questions THEN the Computer Science Assistant SHALL provide code solutions using SageMaker endpoints
5. WHEN I ask general questions THEN the General Assistant SHALL provide helpful responses using SageMaker endpoints
6. WHEN using the Streamlit interface THEN all functionality SHALL work identically to the original system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for SageMaker integration, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SageMaker API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including endpoint name and error type
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on credential configuration
3. WHEN endpoints are not found THEN the system SHALL suggest checking endpoint names and regions
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN system performance is monitored THEN logs SHALL include response times and success rates for SageMaker calls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be testable with temporary AWS credentials, so that I can validate functionality during development and testing phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temporary credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL accept and use them for SageMaker authentication
2. WHEN credentials expire THEN the system SHALL detect expiration and request credential refresh
3. WHEN testing with different credentials THEN the system SHALL support easy credential switching
4. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about authentication failures
